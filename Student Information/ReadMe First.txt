Passwords used in the programme
-------------------------------

====================================================================
= Initial password for Administrator and others: password          =			      
= Password of databases: kingsam2009                               =
= Backdoor of the programme: /bypassadmn2009 (Command line switch) =

What to learn from this programme
---------------------------------

With this simple, but powerful database programme you will mainly learn the followings.

• How to develop a powerful database programme by using ListView, ImageList which includes in Microsoft Windows
  Common Controls, Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Library, Microsoft Excel Object Library. (Because
  of these common and basic dependencies, the executable file of this programme works on any latest 32-bit
  windows operating system (from XP SP2 to Windows 7) without any installation and its execution does not depend on the 
  User Account type, which is Administrator or Limited, which leads for a higher portability.)

• How to easily use Listview control with filtering and exporting techniques (Exporting data with diffrent combination
  of fields) to get the output in various aspects. 

• How to do file handlings like saving database data to text files in different ways.

• How to use clipboard related operations with the data in the database. 

• How to remove unnecessary characters from the data in the database.

• How to use Microsoft Excel for the reporting purpose of the programme. Hence, it is not required to have additional
  reporting interfaces like Crystal reports, Data reports which may require additional dependencies to run.
  (Here, you should only have Microsoft Excel installed on the computer, which is a definite installation on any PC.)

• How to use a simple database programme in a network environment.(Keep the database in a shared location on a file server.
  Then, establish a connection to it with the programme.)

• How to import data from a same structured database while checking the duplicate entries.
  (Because of this feature data can be entered separately with several computers, and 
  finally main database can be updated easily.)

• How to include basic system maintenance features of a database programme like creating users, deleting users,
  setting user permissions, changing user passwords, resetting passwords and etc.

• How to easily implement a simple encryption to encode the required registry location constants, user passwords
  and the database password in the connection string and decrypt them to memory in order to use them in the programme so that
  the actual information can not be seen with Hex/Text editors. (If you think about more security and you do not use an exe
  compressor to compress your executable, this information will be useful to you.)

• How to use a backdoor (An alternate and secret way of entering a computer system) with a database programme to bypass its
  password protected access. (Education purpose only.)

• How to manipulate windows registry to store particular information and utilize them in the programme easily with few lines of code..

• How to do a search in a database programme efficiently and implement an advanced search.

• How to use functions and sub procedures to get the various operations done easily in the programme.

• How to utilize the pictures stored in resource within the programme.

• How to really use a Splash window with a programme.

• How to use a good looking and easily-created progress bar without any additional coding, for the operations of the programme
  with the database. (Operations include clearing data, importing data, exporting data, formatting data with the database.)

• How to create a well-arranged, good looking and flexible user interface with professional features in ease, in a limited screen area.

• If you are a beginner you will learn how to create an application with professional features in ease with basic programmeming skills you have
  without going for a complicated coding style.


What to do initially
--------------------
1. It's better if you can make the executable file of the programme first.
2. Configure the database location as ...\Databases\Main_DB\Main_Std_Info.mdb and log on as Administrator.
3. You will be prompted to the Options screen where you can configure various options. The default file saving
   location will be your application path by default. Just change it if needed.
4. Set the Email Client application if needed.
5. If you wish configure the other settings as well.
6. Go for programme's operations with sample data included.

How to use some of Programme Operations
---------------------------------------

   To Export Data from the database:
   ---------------------------------
   Configure the database location as ...\Databases\Main_DB\Main_Std_Info.mdb and use Export feature from Data View/Export.


   To Format Data in the database:
   -------------------------------
   Clear the database location from options.
   Configure the database location as ...\Databases\Format_DB\Format_std_Info.mdb and use Format Data feature from Data View/Export or Options.
   You will see how unnecessary characters are removed with the Format Data feature.


   To Import Data from a same structured database:
   -----------------------------------------------
   Clear the database location from options.

	Import to a blank Database:
	---------------------------
	Configure the database location as ...\Databases\Blank_DB\Blank_std_Info.mdb and select 
	...\Databases\Main_DB\Main_Std_Info.mdb from Options and use Import Data feature.

	Import to a Database with data:
	-------------------------------
	Configure the database location as ...\Databases\Import_DB_To\Import_std_Info_To.mdb and select 
	...\Databases\Import_DB_From\Import_std_Info_From.mdb from Options and use Import Data feature.

	
   To clear all data in the database
   ---------------------------------
   Go to options and select the relevent option (Student Information or Course Information) from Database Configuration to delete the relevent
   Data.	

===========================================================================================================================================================

Note:
-----
* This is a simple database programme which was developed for a particular purpose only. Some of its features may go beyond its scope,
  which I included them as demonstration and education purpose only. If you find them useful you may use them in your own programmes.

* This database programme has been evaluated as good in its use because of its great portability and flexibility. (If this programme is used in a simple 
  working environment with network facility, the only thing the system administrator should do is, allocating a seperate place on a file server to keep
  the database, with applicable permisstion to the relevent domain users.)

* If you think that this programme is helpful to you in whatever manner, please let me know your comments, suggestions and questions. I do appreciate
  them. Further, don't forget to vote me only if you think that this should be voted.	

**** Happy Coding..... ****
